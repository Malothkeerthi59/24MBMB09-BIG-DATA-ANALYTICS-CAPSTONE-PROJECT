This project applies Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning to analyze social media posts related to agriculture in order to forecast market trends, predict commodity prices, detect pest outbreaks, and analyze farmer sentiment in real time.

By leveraging PySpark on Databricks, the project builds an end-to-end automated data pipeline that transforms raw social data into actionable insights for farmers, policymakers, and agricultural businesses.
